**Product Vision:** 
We have to facilitate the students in a way that they don’t have to visit every university they are interested in and they will get every information regarding their interested university.

 The first version of our will provide the basic information of the university including prospectus, fees structure and eligibility criteria. We will also notify the students about the admission dates.
